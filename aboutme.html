          <p>I am a motivated and enthusiastic biotechnologist with a great desire to act and learn. I like working with people from whom I learn a lot and discover new opportunities. However, I strive for independence in performing my tasks and I willingly share my knowledge. Self-education gave me crusial skills in my private and professional life.
            Recently, I find satisfaction in programming, where the continuity of events gives me a chance to use the potential of logical and analytical thinking. This is my new way to spend time effectively and self-development.
            Privately, I like to rest among nature (as far as possible from the madness of the 21st century) and people close and kind to me.

            <p>"I had the opportunity to work with Agata during realization of 3 scientific projects. Essentially, she did not refuse realization of any new tasks, even if they were completely new, without well-known procedures. Additionally, she was precise and independent in many activities which required such skills."
